            // Your goal is to lead a user, through the use of WriteLine's and ReadLine's,
            // through an open house. This is an open ended project that is meant to be
            // creative. 
            // A good place to start is by introducing the open house and asking the
            // user if they would like to see a particular room. 
            // Ex. "Welcome to the open house", "Would you like to see the kitchen?"
            //      then grab the users response and continue your program based on their answer.

            // Some things to keep in mind:
            //  -Use methods when repeating segments of code.
            //    ex. If you are testing for "yes" or "no" as a user response for multiple questions
            //        try making a method that takes a question and checks if the user entered "yes" or "no".
            //  -Make commits in git as you go, and work on a branch.
            //  -This is a self driven project, the goal is to push yourself and see what you can build.
